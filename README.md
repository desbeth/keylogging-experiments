# keylogging-experiments
As I start my experimentation in computing security, I have decided to follow a keylogging tutorial. The thing is, pynput has so many different options that I hope to look into. One of my goals is to create a Python rubber ducky script using pynput to do something. I do not exactly know what, but I will get there eventually.
